An internship with FFP will provide interns with practical work experience in the international relations field and exposure to diverse national and international audiences including government, multilateral, business, think tank, and NGO communities.What kind of responsibilities do Interns have?Intern responsibilities can include:Conflict analysisConflict data codingResearching and writing articles and reportsAssisting with editing and proofreadingMonitoring and updating essential country-specific dataProviding support to The Fund for Peaces public eventsAttending conferences and roundtables on behalf of The Fund for PeaceDoes The Fund for Peace accept international candidates?Yes. Of course, international staff must have authorization to work (or at least intern) in the US If a visa is required, The Fund for Peace is more than happy to assist you with the paperwork. Obtaining the proper visa may incur significant cost. However, many previous international interns who have had to pay for their visas believe it was money well-spent.

That said, such a transition is far from guaranteed! Nevertheless, the Fund for Peace internship does provide unparalleled exposure to the NGO, think-tank and government communities in the US and abroad.Does The Fund for Peace accept only full-time interns?No. FFP is able to accommodate both full-time and part-time interns (depending on semester). During the fall and spring term, interns at FFP are asked to work approximately 20 hours per week. During the summer term, interns work 30 hours per week at minimum. Normal hours are 9:30 am to 5:00 pm, although we can be flexible about scheduling where necessary.Also, the FFP internship program is specifically flexible in regards to class schedules. Plenty of interns will combine a part-time internship with a normal class schedule.What qualities are we seeking in our interns?Though academic and professional qualifications are obviously important, we also prefer our interns to be well-rounded and personable.Experience with or understanding of the Fund for Peaces programmatic areasExcellent written and oral communication skillsSolid organizational abilitiesIndividual initiative and flexibilityStrong research and data skillsAbility to work independently as well as part of a teamWhat is the average duration of an internship?The length of an internship varies. We prefer interns to work with us for at least 3-4 months. Some interns have actually worked with us for 6 months or more.Is the internship paid or unpaid?FFP offers a stipend to cover commuting expenses. Based on a full work week, pro rated for part-time interns, the stipend is as follows:Part-time - $350 per monthFull-time - $700 per monthDoes The Fund for Peace prefer graduate students to undergraduate?Yes.

138,Market Operations Manager,Carvana,"About Carvana….

At Carvana, we sell cars, but we’re not salespeople. Since 2013, we’ve been making it our mission to change the way people buy cars. We saw a huge problem with how much it can suck to buy a car the traditional way, so we committed ourselves to tackling one of the largest, yet-to-be-disrupted markets in the world – the $1T per year U.S. car market (yes, that’s $Trillion with a “T”).

With the ability to search thousands of vehicles from our expansive inventory, to high-resolution 360° photographs of our vehicles’ interior and exterior, to real-time financing and the ability to complete contracts without visiting the back room of a dealership, we provide a seamless, online car buying experience for consumers that can be completed from their desktop or mobile device. All our vehicles are inspected and reconditioned based on our 150-point certification checklist and come with a 7-day return policy. We also operate our own logistics network to deliver cars to customers as soon as the next day, as well as offer customer pick-up at our state-of-the-art Car Vending Machine locations (yes, you read that right). By putting customer satisfaction at the core of our business, we’ve built a no-pressure, no-haggle online car buying experience that save our customers time and money.

For more information on Carvana, take a look at our company introduction video.



You'll need to be a great communicator, a brand ambassador, and possess the know how to get the job done.

In return for your hard work, you'll have an opportunity to work at one of the fastest growing and creative technology companies around, as well as help us promote a life-changing product and develop a world-class team every day. In our down time we have ping pong and corn hole (or “bags,” depending on where you’re from) tournaments. However, the pace is pretty quick around here, so you'll need to be prepared to keep up.



Market Operations Managers (also known as MOMs) at Carvana play a dynamic role. They need to be great communicators, brand ambassadors, and possess the know-how to get the job done.
